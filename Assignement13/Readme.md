# 🚀 Node.js Advanced Middleware Architecture  
### _University Project — Task 1 & Task 2 Implementation_

---

## 📘 Overview

This project demonstrates advanced **Express.js middleware architecture** concepts through two key tasks:

- **Task 1:** Streaming & Backpressure + Client Abort-Aware Middleware  
- **Task 2:** Content Negotiation Middleware (JSON vs. XML)

It focuses on middleware order, clean structure, and robust error handling.

---

## 🧠 Task 1 — Streaming & Backpressure + Client Abort-Aware Middleware

### 🎯 Goal
Implement a **streaming NDJSON endpoint** that:
- Produces continuous JSON objects line by line.
- Properly handles **backpressure**.
- Stops streaming immediately when the **client disconnects**.

---

### ⚙️ Features
✅ NDJSON streaming output  
✅ Handles `res.write()` buffer with backpressure control  
✅ Detects client disconnect via `AbortController`  
✅ Graceful cleanup of background work  
✅ Middleware stack:
  - Request ID correlation  
  - Response timing  
  - JSON body limit  
  - CORS whitelist  
  - Centralized error handling  

---

### 🧩 Endpoints

#### **GET /stream**
Streams NDJSON data.


# 🌐 Task 2 — Content Negotiation Middleware (JSON vs. XML)

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement **Content Negotiation** in **Node.js (Express.js)** using a reusable middleware that dynamically returns responses in **JSON** or **XML**, based on the `Accept` header of the incoming request.

It follows best practices for middleware design, RFC-7807 error handling, and secure Express app configuration.

---

## 🎯 Goal
Build a middleware that:
- Returns **JSON** or **XML** depending on the client’s `Accept` header.
- Uses a **reusable `negotiate()`** function for multiple routes.
- Follows **RFC 7807 (problem+json)** for standardized error responses.
- Integrates with a secure and ordered middleware pipeline.

---

## ⚙️ Features
✅ Supports both `application/json` and `application/xml`  
✅ Returns a **406 Not Acceptable** for unsupported types  
✅ Built on **Express.js** with clean, modular middleware  
✅ Centralized **RFC-7807 error handling**  
✅ Includes headers: `X-Request-Id` and `X-Response-Time-ms`  
✅ Easily extendable for other formats  

---

## 🧩 Endpoints

### **GET /user/:id**
Returns user details based on the requested format.

#### JSON Request:
```bash
curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:3000/user/1

curl -N http://localhost:3000/stream
